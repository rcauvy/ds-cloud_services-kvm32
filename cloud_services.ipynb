    "## Hardware Acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as software libraries like NumPy or Spark can improve the efficiency of code, there is a limit to how much of a difference they can make, depending on the actual hardware of your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general concept, [hardware acceleration](https://www.omnisci.com/learn/resources/technical-glossary/hardware-acceleration) means using purpose-built hardware rather than general-purpose hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of machine learning, this typically means running your code on a GPU, rather than a CPU.  A CPU _can_ do everything that a GPU can do, but it is not optimized for it, so it will likely take more time.  [This blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-your-gpu-dollars-a9133f4e546a) argues that a CPU is to a GPU as a horse and buggy is to a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to use cloud computing just for the GPU!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud Services with Hardware Acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of overlap between these services and the services listed on the Deployment page, but you may need to configure them specifically to indicate that you want to use a GPU:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/train-deep-learning-models-on-gpus-using-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/)\n",
    " - [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/using-gpus)\n",
    " - [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_gpus.html)\n",
    " - [Azure VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some cloud IDEs with GPUs, where you can run Jupyter Notebook code:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/accelerate-machine-learning-P3/) (there are labs in Canvas introducing Sagemaker â€” it is fairly fast and easy to use, but can get expensive quickly with large datasets)\n",
    " - [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/)\n",
    " - [Google Colab](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c)\n",
    " - [Kaggle kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/running-kaggle-kernels-with-a-gpu)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also upload Jupyter notebooks to data.world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is a GPU available in the free tier, Google Colab is the most popular of these tools for our students. [Here](https://medium.com/@sam.bbmgmt/integrating-google-drive-colab-with-github-bffaca97eb5b) is a blog post from a former student explaining how to use the file system!"

   "source": [
    "## Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "It's annoying to have huge data files taking up space on your laptop, and if you want to train your model in the cloud, your data also needs to be in the cloud.  But for reasons related to hardware acceleration, it can get pretty expensive to store large datasets in general-purpose cloud services like an EC2 instance or a cloud VM.  That's when cloud storage services become useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud Storage Buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "The major providers of storage \"buckets\" are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/getting-started/)\n",
    " - [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)\n",
    " - [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are designed for uploads of raw files, e.g. folders full of images, CSVs, or JSONs.\n",
    "\n",
    "They each cost about 2-5 cents per GB per month.  AWS S3 is the oldest and tends to have the most integration support with other platforms, although you may need to use Google storage if you're using other Google products or Azure storage if you're using other Azure products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to deploy a website where new information gets saved (what kinds of queries users perform, user ratings of the quality of predictions, etc.) then you need a cloud database.  These work roughly the same as a database running on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a cloud database is mainly an opportunity to practice using tooling that you are likely to use on the job, because they assist with collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular providers are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)\n",
    " - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)\n",
    " - [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)\n",
    " - [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)\n",

    "## Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have resources for three different techniques for deploying a machine learning model:\n",
    "1. Full-stack web application\n",
    "2. Cloud function\n",
    "3. ML-specific deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full-Stack Web Application Example: Flask\n",
    "Flask means developing a full-stack web application. It follows a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern and requires that you sometimes have to follow a \"convention over configuration\" pattern and put certain files in certain folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways I recommend deploying a Flask app: [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python), or [AWS EC2](https://www.codementor.io/dushyantbgs/deploying-a-flask-application-to-aws-gnva38cf0). The main difference is that Heroku uses \"dynos\", a type of container that gets fully re-created when the site is \"woken up\" based on certain config files it finds in a GitHub repo.  EC2 is more like a \"real\" computer, where you can SSH in and download things, log out, log back in, and those things will still be there.  EC2 gives you more configuration capabilities and more computational power, but also requires more setup than Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pricing\n",
    "[Heroku free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) allows one web app for free. The [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) allows 750 hours of \"micro\" level server time per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    " - Free\n",
    " - Allows you to become more familiar with web development and have a shared vocabulary with software developers\n",
    " - You can generate data visualizations in Python (don't need to learn JavaScript, only HTML and CSS)\n",
    " - Supports a multi-step process with more than one user interaction\n",
    " - Single solution to get a live user interface you can link from your portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    " - Learning curve for all of Flask can be steep\n",
    " - More systems administration work than a cloud function or ML model\n",
    " - Less realistic workflow (unless you are the only technical person on your team, you will probably not be expected to set up a web server)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Documentation\n",

    "\n",
    "Google Cloud Functions allow you to make a single function that can be called from a REST API interface.  The Python language versions are actually running on top of Flask, with as much boilerplate removed as possible.  So you still need to learn some Flask to be able to get everything working.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to 2 million free Cloud Function invocations per month. The [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/) requires signing up with a credit card, but promises \"No autocharge after free trial ends\".\n",

    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    " - Free\n",
    " - Makes a REST API interface, so you can demo with Postman or an HTML + JS web frontend (or collaborate with an SE alum to make a React frontend for you)\n",
    " - Only requires you to learn a little bit of Flask.  Nothing about production WSGI servers, or nginx, or ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    " - Not making a full-stack web app means you won't have the experience of making a full-stack web app.\n",
    " - Sometimes there is a lot of \"magic\" happening with the implicit Flask app that makes it hard to debug. Probably will not be compatible with TensorFlow, for example, because you don't have fine-grained control over the threading behavior.\n",
    " - If you want to deploy a web frontend, you'll need to find another tool. (GitHub Pages works fine though!)\n",
    " - The platform is not designed specifically for ML models, so it might be annoyingly slow, or even so slow that it times out.\n",
    " - You can't generate any data visualizations in Python; they will have to be in JavaScript.\n",

    "### ML-Specific Deployment Example: Google Cloud AI Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Cloud AI Platform allows you to upload an exported model to the cloud, then make future requests to the cloud to make new predictions. The primary use case seems to be people who are already very integrated into the Google Cloud ecosystem, since they encourage requesting predictions through their custom SDK in Python rather than through a standard REST API interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like there is no free tier for this service. [Pricing summary here.](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/pricing)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    " - After installing their CLI, you only need to upload the model itself, no additional libraries or frameworks.\n",
    " - If you need better performance, it's easy to pay more money to get that.\n",
    " - This is a \"real\" tool that you might encounter on the job, and resembles most closely the type of systems administration you might need to do on the job.\n",
    " - If you need to use TensorFlow, Google made both TensorFlow and this product, so they're likely to be the most compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    " - Not free.\n",
    " - No clear, easy way to make an \"open\" REST API that can communicate with Postman or a simple web frontend.\n",
    " - Requires versioning and other configuration work that is not necessary for our projects.\n",

Do this by navigating to \"Networking\" --> \"Virtual Cloud Networks\" in the main menu, selecting your network (should be only one, created by default), selecting \"Security Lists\" in the bottom left menu, selecting \"Default Security List\", then clicking the blue \"Add Ingress Rules\" button.
